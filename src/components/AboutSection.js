            Shri DarbariLalJi was a visionary and a leading light in the field
            of education. He was born on 15th January 1930. His birthday shall
            be celebrated as school Founderâ€™s Day. Words cannot describe nor do
            justice to the greatness and wisdom of this great man. He was like a
            sweet melody; the music of his intellect still reverberates in the
            form of his ideologies and principles. The school takes great pride
            in the fact that it has been founded in his auspicious memory. He
            sailed into the spiritual world on 16th May 1995 and mingled with
            the holy as that is where he belonged.
